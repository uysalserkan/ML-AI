For example, you will be able to describe the difference between eager mode and graph mode in TensorFlow, and explain why eager mode is very user friendly for you as a developer. You will also use TensorFlow tools to calculate gradients so that you donâ€™t have to look for your old calculus textbooks next time you need to get a gradient!"

If a tf.constant held the values one, two, three, four, five, six, you couldn't replace the one with a zero or append another number seven at the end of this tensor, you'd have to create a new tf.constant if you wanted to store a different set of values. \n",
